# microstructure-classification

This model was trained on dendrictic and non dendrictic images to distinguish between dendrictic and non dendrictic microstructures. 
The model was successfully trained and is able to classify between the two microstrcutures. 
The model details and model initialization can be found in *BuildingModel* notebook.
The model usage and summary can be found in *modeltest* notebook

The model was inspired by the the learning material from the Deep Learning course by Andrew Ng in coursera
